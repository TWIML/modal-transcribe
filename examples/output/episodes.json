In our conversation, we dive into the topic of vector databases and retrieval augmented generation (RAG). We explore the trade-offs between relying solely on LLMs for retrieval tasks versus combining retrieval in vector databases and LLMs, the advantages and complexities of RAG with vector databases, the key considerations for building and deploying real-world RAG-based applications, and an in-depth look at Pinecone's new serverless offering. Currently in public preview, Pinecone Serverless is a vector database that enables on-demand data loading, flexible scaling, and cost-effective query processing. Ram discusses how the serverless paradigm impacts the vector database\u2019s core architecture, key features, and other considerations. Lastly, Ram shares his perspective on the future of vector databases in helping enterprises deliver RAG systems.\n\nThe complete show notes for this episode can be found at twimlai.com/go/669.",

The first tool we discuss, Fawkes, imperceptibly \u201ccloaks\u201d images in such a way that models perceive them as highly distorted, effectively shielding individuals from recognition by facial recognition models. We then dig into Glaze, a tool that employs machine learning algorithms to compute subtle alterations that are indiscernible to human eyes but adept at tricking the models into perceiving a significant shift in art style, giving artists a unique defense against style mimicry. Lastly, we cover Nightshade, a strategic defense tool for artists akin to a 'poison pill' which allows artists to apply imperceptible changes to their images that effectively \u201cbreaks\u201d generative AI models that are trained on them.\n\nThe complete show notes for this episode can be found at twimlai.com/go/668.",

Specifically, we dig into DreamBooth, an algorithm that enables \u201csubject-driven generation,\u201d that is, the creation of personalized generative models using a small set of user-provided images about a subject. The personalized models can then be used to generate the subject in various contexts using a text prompt. Nataniel gives us a dive deep into the fine-tuning approach used in DreamBooth, the potential reasons behind the algorithm\u2019s effectiveness, the challenges of fine-tuning diffusion models in this way, such as language drift, and how the prior preservation loss technique avoids this setback, as well as the evaluation challenges and metrics used in DreamBooth. We also touched base on his other recent papers including SuTI, StyleDrop, HyperDreamBooth, and lastly, Platypus.\n\nThe complete show notes for this episode can be found at twimlai.com/go/648.",

In our conversation with Aljosa, we explore his broader research interests in achieving robot vision, and his vision for what it will look like when that goal is achieved. The first paper we dig into is Text2Pos: Text-to-Point-Cloud Cross-Modal Localization, which proposes a cross-modal localization module that learns to align textual descriptions with localization cues in a coarse-to-fine manner. Next up, we explore the paper Forecasting from LiDAR via Future Object Detection, which proposes an end-to-end approach for detection and motion forecasting based on raw sensor measurement as opposed to ground truth tracks. Finally, we discuss Aljosa\u2019s third and final paper Opening up Open-World Tracking, which proposes a new benchmark to analyze existing efforts in multi-object tracking and constructs a baseline for these tasks.\nThe complete show notes for this episode can be found at twimlai.com/go/581",

Been, whose research has historically been focused on interpretability in machine learning, delivered the keynote Beyond interpretability: developing a language to shape our relationships with AI, which explores the need to study AI machines as scientific objects, in isolation and with humans, which will provide principles for tools, but also is necessary to take our working relationship with AI to the next level.\u00a0\nBefore we dig into Been\u2019s talk, she characterizes where we are as an industry and community with interpretability, and what the current state of the art is for interpretability techniques. We explore how the Gestalt principles appear in neural networks, Been\u2019s choice to characterize communication with machines as a language as opposed to a set of principles or foundational understanding, and much much more.\nThe complete show notes for this episode can be found at twimlai.com/go/571",

While we\u2019ve had numerous conversations about the biological inspirations of deep learning models with folks working at the intersection of deep learning and neuroscience, we dig into uncharted territory with Subutai. We set the stage by digging into some of fundamental ideas behind Numenta\u2019s research and the present landscape of neuroscience, before exploring our first big topic of the podcast: the cortical column. Cortical columns are a group of neurons in the cortex of the brain which have nearly identical receptive fields; we discuss the behavior of these columns, why they\u2019re a structure worth mimicing computationally, how far along we are in understanding the cortical column, and how these columns relate to neurons.\n\u00a0\nWe also discuss what it means for a model to have inherent 3d understanding and for computational models to be inherently sensory motor, and where we are with these lines of research. Finally, we dig into our other big idea, sparsity.

While we\u2019ve had numerous conversations about the biological inspirations of deep learning models with folks working at the intersection of deep learning and neuroscience, we dig into uncharted territory with Subutai. We set the stage by digging into some of fundamental ideas behind Numenta\u2019s research and the present landscape of neuroscience, before exploring our first big topic of the podcast: the cortical column. Cortical columns are a group of neurons in the cortex of the brain which have nearly identical receptive fields; we discuss the behavior of these columns, why they\u2019re a structure worth mimicing computationally, how far along we are in understanding the cortical column, and how these columns relate to neurons.\n\u00a0\nWe also discuss what it means for a model to have inherent 3d understanding and for computational models to be inherently sensory motor, and where we are with these lines of research. Finally, we dig into our other big idea, sparsity. We explore the fundamental ideals of sparsity and the differences between sparse and dense networks, and applying sparsity and optimization to drive greater efficiency in current deep learning networks, including transformers and other large language models.\u00a0\n\nThe complete show notes for this episode can be found at twimlai.com/go/562",

In this paper, Rishabh and his coauthors call for a change in how deep RL performance is reported on benchmarks when using only a few runs, acknowledging that typically, DeepRL algorithms are evaluated by the performance on a large suite of tasks. Using the Atari 100k benchmark, they found substantial disparities in the conclusions from point estimates alone versus statistical analysis.

In our conversation, John shares his two major takeaways from last year, 1) NLP as we know it has changed, and we\u2019re back into the incremental phase of the science, and 2) NLP is \u201ceating\u201d the rest of machine learning. We explore the implications of these two major themes across the discipline, as well as best papers, up and coming startups, great things that did happen, and even a few bad things that didn\u2019t. Finally, we explore what 2022 and beyond will look like for NLP, from multilingual NLP to use cases for the influx of large auto-regressive language models like GPT-3 and others, as well as ethical implications that are reverberating across domains and the changes that have been ushered in in that vein.\n\nThe complete show notes for this episode can be found at twimlai.com/go/550",

In our conversation, we explore the idea of compositional AI, and if it is the next frontier in a string of recent game-changing machine learning developments. We also discuss a source of constant back and forth in the community around the role of notebooks, and why Paperspace made the choice to pivot towards a more traditional engineering code artifact model after building a popular notebook service. Finally, we talk through their newest release Workflows, an automation and build system for ML applications, which Dillon calls their \u201cmost ambitious and comprehensive project yet.\u201d\n\nThe complete show notes for this episode can be found at twimlai.com/go/520.",

In our conversation with Yanshuai, we explore his work on Turing, their natural language to SQL engine that allows users to get insights from relational databases without having to write code. We do a bit of compare and contrast with the recently released Codex Model from OpenAI, the role that reasoning plays in solving this problem, and how it is implemented in the model. We also talk through various challenges like data augmentation, the complexity of the queries that Turing can produce, and a paper that explores the explainability of this model.\n\nThe complete show notes for this episode can be found at twimlai.com/go/519.",

We discuss how he\u2019s been applying this to the field of molecular design and discovery via two different methods, with one paper searching for possible chemical reactions, and the other doing the same, but in 3D and in 3D space. We also discuss the challenges of sample efficiency, creating objective functions, and how those manifest themselves in these experiments, and how he integrated the Bayesian approach to RL problems. We also talk through a handful of other papers that Miguel has presented at recent conferences, which are all linked at twimlai.com/go/510.",

        "description": "Today we\u2019re joined by Jamie Macbeth, an assistant professor in the department of computer science at Smith College.\u00a0\n In our conversation with Jamie, we explore his work at the intersection of cognitive systems and natural language understanding, and how to use AI as a vehicle for better understanding human intelligence. We discuss the tie that binds these domains together, if the tasks are the same as traditional NLU tasks, and what are the specific things he\u2019s trying to gain deeper insights into.\n One of the unique aspects of Jamie\u2019s research is that he takes an \u201cold-school AI\u201d approach, and to that end, we discuss the models he handcrafts to generate language. Finally, we examine how he evaluates the performance of his representations if he\u2019s not playing the SOTA \u201cgame,\u201d what he bookmarks against, identifying deficiencies in deep learning systems, and the exciting directions for his upcoming research.\u00a0\n The complete show notes for this episode can be found at https://twimlai.com/go/477.",

Since his departure from the company in 2018, he has been busy building up Tecton, and their enterprise feature store.\u00a0\n In our conversation, Mike walks us through why he chose to focus on the feature store aspects of the machine learning platform, the journey, personal and otherwise, to operationalizing machine learning, and the capabilities that more mature platforms teams tend to look for or need to build. We also explore the differences between standalone components and feature stores, if organizations are taking their existing databases and building feature stores with them, and what a dynamic, always available feature store looks like in deployment.\u00a0\n Finally, we explore what sets Tecton apart from other vendors in this space, including enterprise cloud providers who are throwing their hat in the ring.\n The complete show notes for this episode can be found at twimlai.com/go/420.\n Thanks to our friends at Tecton for sponsoring this episode of the podcast!

Nick and I met at my AI Summit a few weeks back, and after a brief chat about some of the things he was up to at AES, I knew I needed to get him on the show! In this interview, Nick and I explore how AES is implementing machine learning across multiple domains at the company. We dig into several examples falling under the Natural Language, Computer Vision, and Cognitive Assets categories he\u2019s established for his projects. Along the way we cover some of the key podcast episodes that helped Nick discover potentially applicable ML techniques, and how those are helping his team broaden the use of machine learning at AES. This was a fun and informative conversation that has a lot to offer. Thanks, Nick! The notes for this episode can be found at twimlai.com/talk/150.",

        "html_description": "In this episode I\u2019m joined by legendary chess champion, author, and fellow at the Oxford Martin School, Garry Kasparov. Garry and I sat down after his keynote at the Figure Eight Train AI conference in San Francisco last week. Garry and I discuss his bouts with the chess-playing computer Deep Blue\u2013which became the first computer system to defeat a reigning world champion in their 1997 rematch\u2013and how that experience has helped shaped his thinking on artificially intelligent systems. We explore his perspective on the evolution of AI, the ways in which chess and Deep Blue differ from Go and Alpha Go, and the significance of DeepMind\u2019s Alpha Go Zero. We also talk through his views on the relationship between humans and machines, and how he expects it to change over time. The notes for this show can be found at twimlai.com/talk/140.

If you\u2019re not familiar with Fast AI, the company offers a series of courses including Practical Deep Learning for Coders, Cutting Edge Deep Learning for Coders and Rachel\u2019s Computational Linear Algebra course. The courses are designed to make deep learning more accessible to those without the extensive math backgrounds some other courses assume. Rachel and I cover a lot of ground in this conversation, starting with the philosophy and goals behind the Fast AI courses. We also cover Fast AI\u2019s recent decision to switch to their courses from Tensorflow to Pytorch, the reasons for this, and the lessons they\u2019ve learned in the process. We discuss the role of the Fast AI deep learning library as well, and how it was recently used to held their team achieve top results on a popular industry benchmark of training time and training cost by a factor of more than ten.

As you all may know, a few weeks ago we released my interview with Google legend Jeff Dean, which, by the way, you should definitely check if you haven\u2019t already. Anyway, in that interview, Jeff mentions the recent explosion of machine learning papers on arXiv, which I responded to jokingly by asking whether Google had already developed the AI system to help them summarize and track all of them. While Jeff didn\u2019t have anything specific to offer, a listener reached out and let me know that John was in fact already working on this problem. In our conversation, John and I discuss his work on Primer Science, a tool that harvests content uploaded to arxiv, sorts it into natural topics using unsupervised learning, then gives relevant summaries of the activity happening in different innovation areas. We spend a good amount of time on the inner workings of Primer Science, including their data pipeline and some of the tools they use, how they determine \u201cground truth\u201d for training their models, and the use of heuristics to supplement NLP in their processing.
