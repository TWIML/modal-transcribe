# Bruno API Client Readme

## About 

This folder contains API configuration files for the Bruno API Client. Bruno is similar to Postman or Insomnia but open source and fully offline.

Download here: https://www.usebruno.com

## Usage

1. Download Bruno
2. Copy ModalDev.bru.example to ModalDev.bru and customize to your Modal app URL
3. Choose Open Collection and navigate to the folder containing bruno.json
4. Select the ModelDev environment using the dropdown at the upper right of the Bruno window.

Now you can select an API method from the pane at the left, fill in any required body json, and execute the API command by clicking the right arrow.

## Updating

As the API is updated, the Bruno config will need to be updated accordingly. This can be done manually by following the formatting in the .bru files. 

Alternatively, this process was used to create the initial config:

1. Hit the https://{modal host}/openapi.json endpoint to grab the OpenAPI v3 spec auto-generated by FastAPI. Save it to a file.
2. Use the Bruno UI to import the collection someplace and overwrite the old stuff.
3. Update the URLs using search & replace to use the {host} variable.
